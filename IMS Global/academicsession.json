Other words for term could be in common use around the world e.g. Semester. The important thing is that Term is a unit of time, often many weeks long, into which classes are scheduled. Grading Period is used to represent another unit of time, that within which line items are assessed. A term may have many grading periods, a grading period belongs to a single term. A class may be assessed over several grade periods (represented by a line item being connected to a grading period). The parent / child attributes of academic sessions allow terms to be connected to their grading periods and vice-versa. ",

The sourcedId of an object is considered an addressable property of an entity and as such will not be treated as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by certified products.  Therefore, as a part of certification, vendors will be required to declare that they will notify customers via documentation or other formal and documented agreement that sourcedIds should never contain PII in general, but particularly users. This means that if a customer includes a student name in an enrollment.sourcedId, it will not fall to any certified product to protect the enrollment.sourcedId as PII, or even the userSourcedId field in the enrollment record.",
